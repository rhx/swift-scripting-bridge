/// An enumeration type that defines a set of named constant values.
///
/// SDEF enumerations define sets of predefined constant values that provide symbolic
/// names for specific Apple Event codes used throughout the scripting interface. These
/// enumerations enable type-safe programming by restricting property values and command
/// parameters to well-defined sets of constants, improving both code reliability and
/// documentation clarity.
///
/// Each enumeration contains a collection of enumerators, where each enumerator represents
/// a specific constant value with its own four-character Apple Event code. The enumeration
/// system maps human-readable symbolic names to the underlying codes used in Apple Event
/// communication, making scripts more readable and maintainable while preserving the
/// precise semantics required by the Apple Event system.
