/// A property of a scriptable class that can be read or modified through scripting.
///
/// Properties represent the attributes of scriptable objects that can be accessed and
/// potentially modified through Apple Events. Each property encapsulates both the data
/// type information and access control characteristics that govern how external scripts
/// can interact with the attribute. Properties form the primary interface for reading
/// and writing object state through the scripting system.
///
/// The property definition includes a four-character Apple Event code that uniquely
/// identifies the property in scripting commands, a type specification that defines
/// the expected data format, and access permissions that may restrict operations to
/// read-only, write-only, or full read-write access. Properties may also include
/// Cocoa key names that enable better integration with modern Swift naming conventions.
