/// A scriptable class that represents an object type within the application's object model.
///
/// SDEF classes define the structure and behaviour of objects that can be manipulated through
/// Apple Events scripting. Each class represents a distinct type of object in the application's
/// domain, such as a document, window, or application-specific entity. Classes encapsulate both
/// data (through properties) and behaviour (through command responses), providing a complete
/// object model for scripting interactions.
///
/// The class definition includes properties that can be read or modified, elements that represent
/// collections of child objects, and command associations that specify which operations the class
/// supports. Classes can inherit from other classes, forming an inheritance hierarchy that enables
/// code reuse and maintains consistent behaviour across related object types.
///
/// Each class has a four-character Apple Event code that uniquely identifies it in the scripting
/// system, enabling precise object type resolution and command routing. The class may also specify
/// whether it should be hidden from normal scripting use, which is useful for internal or
/// deprecated object types.
public struct SDEFClass: Codable, Sendable {
    /// The singular name of this class.
    ///
    /// This name is used in scripting dictionaries and code generation
    /// to identify individual instances of the class. It should be
    /// descriptive and follow standard naming conventions.
    public let name: String

    /// The plural form used when referring to collections of this class.

    /// If not specified, a standard pluralisation will be applied.

    /// The four-character Apple Event code that identifies this class.

    /// paragraphs, and an application might contain documents.
