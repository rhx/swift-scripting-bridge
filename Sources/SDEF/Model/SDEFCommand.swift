/// A scriptable command that can be executed on objects within the application.
///
/// Commands represent actions that can be performed through Apple Events scripting,
/// providing the primary mechanism for external scripts to invoke application functionality.
/// Each command defines a complete interface specification including parameters, return types,
/// and routing information that determines how the command is executed within the application.
///
/// Commands can be targeted at specific objects or at the application as a whole, depending
/// on their definition and the capabilities of the receiving object. The command structure
/// includes both a direct parameter (the primary object or value the command acts upon) and
/// optional named parameters that modify the command's behaviour or provide additional data.
/// This flexible parameter system enables commands to handle complex operations while maintaining
/// clear and consistent interfaces for script authors.
