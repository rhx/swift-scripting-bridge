/// Information about an included SDEF file that was processed during parsing.
///
/// When an SDEF file includes other definitions via xi:include directives, this structure
/// tracks the information needed to generate separate Swift files for the included content.
/// This enables modular code generation where shared definitions (such as those from
/// CocoaStandard.sdef) can be processed once and referenced across multiple generated
/// Swift files, maintaining consistency and reducing duplication.
///
/// The structure preserves both the original reference URL and the processed model,
/// allowing the code generator to create appropriate imports and references in the
/// final Swift output.
public struct SDEFInclude: Codable {
    /// The original href URL from the xi:include directive.
    ///
    /// This typically points to system-level SDEF files such as
    /// `file://localhost/System/Library/ScriptingDefinitions/CocoaStandard.sdef`.
    public let href: String

    /// The basename that should be used for the generated Swift file.
    ///
    /// This becomes the module name for the included definitions,
    /// allowing other generated code to import and reference these types.
    public let basename: String

    /// The model containing all definitions from the included file.

    /// This includes all suites, classes, enumerations, and commands
    /// defined in the included SDEF file, fully parsed and ready for
    /// code generation.

    /// This initialiser is typically called by the SDEF parser when processing
    /// xi:include directives in the source XML. The parser recursively processes
    /// included files, creating a complete model hierarchy.
